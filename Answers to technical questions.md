# Answers to Technical Questions

### 1. How long did you spend on the coding test?

I spent approximately **3** hours daily on the coding test. This includes time for planning, coding, testing, and debugging.

### 2. What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you've used it.

The most useful recent feature in JavaScript (ES2020) is the **optional chaining operator (`?.`)**. This feature allows for safe property access, which reduces the need for multiple checks to ensure that an object or its nested properties exist before accessing them. Itâ€™s especially useful for handling API responses or working with complex, nested data structures where properties might not always be present.

#### Example Usage:

```javascript
// Assuming `userProfile` is an object that might or might not have certain nested properties.
const userProfile = {
  name: "Alex",
  contactInfo: {
    email: "alex@example.com"
  }
};

// Safely accessing nested properties using optional chaining:
const userEmail = userProfile.contactInfo?.email;
console.log(userEmail); // Output: "alex@example.com"

// If a property does not exist, it simply returns `undefined` instead of throwing an error.
const userPhone = userProfile.contactInfo?.phone?.number;
console.log(userPhone); // Output: undefined
```
Optional chaining has made code cleaner and more readable by reducing the amount of error-prone conditional statements required to check for the existence of each level in nested objects.

### 3. How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?

To troubleshoot a performance issue in production:

1. **Monitor and Log**: Use tools like New Relic or CloudWatch to identify slow endpoints.
2. **Profile**: Narrow down bottlenecks with profilers (Chrome DevTools, Node.js profilers).
3. **Optimize Database Queries**: Check query plans and add indexes as needed.
4. **Implement Caching**: Use Redis or in-memory caching for frequently accessed data.
5. **Scale Resources**: Consider adding servers or load balancing if resource limits are reached.

**Experience**: Not yet.

### 4. If you had more time, what additional features or improvements would you consider adding to the task management application?

Additional features and improvements:

- **User Authentication** for secure, user-specific task management.
- **Real-Time Collaboration** using WebSockets or Socket.io.
- **Reminders and Notifications** via email or push notifications.
- **UI/UX Enhancements** like drag-and-drop and customizable themes.
- **Offline Support** through a service worker for continued functionality without internet.
- **Performance Optimization** through lazy loading and code-splitting.

These would enhance usability, scalability, and overall user experience.
